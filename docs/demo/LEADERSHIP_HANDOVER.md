# ORVIA prototype: leadership handover

**Owner:** GPT Work, successor to Cowork (C02) · **Status:** PREPARED_NOT_FROZEN (blocked on A07 candidate and B06 browser results) · **Revision:** c02-r4, 16 Sep 2026 UTC · **Documentation base:** `9bb8f2900909997f63db864eeea1211523aa5819`

## How to use this document

This is the presentation content. Its claims **cannot be frozen** yet: no packaged final candidate, full-scenario acceptance, candidate browser result, screenshot, recording or qualifying rehearsal is supplied. Historical engineering reports exist and are indexed separately.

Where a statement depends on evidence, it is written as the claim to be made **once evidenced**, and it points to its register entry in [`CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`](CLAIMS_REGISTER.md). Until then, present only §1, §5, §6 and §7, and say plainly that the working demonstration is not ready.

All 18 designed workspace and Privacy Centre screens are implemented as tracked Next routes. A complete Playwright run at this exact commit passed 16/16. Screen-level browser results are still NOT_RUN because the reporter emits no BROWSER_ACCEPTANCE record with screen_ids (finding FINAL-CONT-F08); source inspection is not browser acceptance and neither is Work acceptance or a human rehearsal. |

## 1. Opening (say this whether or not the demo runs)

> "ORVIA is meant to do four things: record what should happen to a person's data, control a supported action, coordinate the downstream work, and show what actually happened — including the failures and gaps. This prototype tests that on one path, marketing-consent withdrawal, using fictional organisations on a local machine, with no AI model involved."

## 2. Core withdrawal demonstration (only once evidenced)

The step-by-step sequence is [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](../prototype/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) §4. In summary, the prototype must show:

1. **Asha, a fictional person, withdraws marketing consent.** She gets a receipt that says only that the withdrawal is recorded. (CL-06)
2. **The synthetic CRM audience actually changes,** and ORVIA confirms it with a separate read. (CL-08, CL-09)
3. **A queued marketing message is blocked at the local send point.** The order-service update is judged on its own condition. (CL-05, CL-10)

**Evidence status:** every item is MISSING (T08, T09, T12–T15).

## 3. Uncertainty and manual gaps (only once evidenced)

- **Lost reply.** When a system applies a change but its reply is lost, ORVIA says *outcome unknown* and reads the system before deciding anything. (CL-11)
- **No API.** A system with no API becomes a person's task. The person's record is kept as a statement, not as an observation, and the workflow stays *Needs attention* until its rule is met. (CL-12)
- **Live counts.** The overview shows these as live counts. It is not a compliance score. (CL-13)

**Evidence status:** MISSING (T17–T21). T18 and T19 are mandatory tests even if they are not shown live.

## 4. Regression and recovery (only once evidenced)

- **Regression.** A deliberately broken, test-only sender is caught by an assertion that looks at what was sent. The healthy rerun is recorded separately. (CL-15)
- **Recovery.** A worker restart neither loses nor repeats the accepted action. An old synthetic CRM copy restored into quarantine stays blocked until it is reconciled. This is target-only, not disaster recovery. (CL-16)
- **Offline run.** With internet blocked, the core runs, and no unapproved traffic appears during the tested interval. (CL-17)

**Evidence status:** MISSING (T11, T23–T26).

## 5. Scoped value statement

> "If the evidence holds, we will have shown that ORVIA can turn a person's choice into a controlled and honestly reported outcome on systems we map — observed where ORVIA can read the system, and saying 'unknown' and 'manual' when that is the truth. That is the foundation for Version 1. It is not yet a product, an integration catalogue, or a compliance certificate."

## 6. Limitations to state

These are stated even after the evidence exists.

- **Fictional data and synthetic, local systems only.** No Salesforce, HubSpot, SMS, email or payment integrations.
- **Only the local supported send point is controlled.** There is no company-wide interception, and messages already handed off cannot be recalled.
- **Withdrawal stops marketing use.** It does not erase data. Rights, retention and guardian flows are not built.
- **Evidence digests detect changes against a trusted copy.** They are not legal certificates.
- **No production security, HA, disaster recovery, SSO, licensing or update infrastructure.** No penetration test.
- **The wider Version 1 programme is larger.** The master lists 33 modules: 26 are in Version 1, and seven custom-AI modules (IDs 19–25) are deferred to Version 2 (EV-SRC-004). The genuine 33-module register is restored (F-002 resolved). Its original NOT_INSPECTED values make no module-completion claim; the source-backed capability mapping states partial implementation and remaining evidence. API/UI mapping remains F-029. Unbuilt Version 1 work stays in Version 1.
- **No legal-compliance claim of any kind.** (CL-22)

## 7. Next engineering decisions for leadership

| Decision | Why it matters now | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Confirm the presentation date and time (IST), and what leadership is asked to decide | Sets the cut line; nothing is timed today (F-015) | Human |
| Review the completed C00 handoff and its narrow Codex cross-check | Unblocks B00 acceptance without waiting for completed UI | Human / Codex |
| Preserve accepted A00/A01 and review A02/A03/A04 correction evidence | Those increments exist; no restart or invented acceptance | Work / Codex |
| If time is short, accept a smaller truthful slice rather than the full outcome demo | EXECUTION_PLAN §6–§7: a partial demo must not be labelled complete | Human with Work |
| Close remaining producer/consumer gaps: quarantine/retry/count/reason codes, candidate receipt-history binding and safe request recovery | Needed before the UI can bind honestly (F-006, F-008, F-016, F-018) | Work → Codex, Codex |
| Production path after the demo: security review, legal review, real connector selection, deployment model | The prototype is a foundation, not a release | Leadership |

## 8. Prepared answers to leadership and CTO questions

Answers are written to stay true today. Update the evidence references when artifacts exist.

**What actually ran?**
Work inspected 221 supplied A00–A05/correction engineering command reports and their referenced bytes; original failures and dirty-source identities remain. Accepted increments are A00/A01. A02/A03/A04/A05 and the merged PR #16 correction are implementation/report inputs awaiting consolidated acceptance. Work executed document tools and canonical tracking checks in this session; it did not execute application services or scenarios.

**What remains incomplete?**
- The 30 P0 full-scenario candidate gates are still NOT_RUN; partial producer assertions do not close them.
- No A07 packaged candidate or B06 application browser evidence is supplied.
- Workspace/Privacy Centre UI routes are absent at the inspected base; Codex owns their existing B IDs.
- A04–A07 enforcement/evidence/fault/recovery/package procedures and their applicable tests remain required.
- No qualifying rehearsal or human readiness sign-off exists.

`FINDINGS.csv` lists the owners.

**What does a receipt prove?**
That the organisation's ORVIA installation durably saved the person's choice, with its version number and time, in the same transaction as the follow-up work. It does not prove that any downstream system changed. The stored receipt never changes; current progress is shown separately with its own time. (CL-06)

**What does an observation prove?**
That ORVIA read a specific target record, by a named method, at a recorded time and generation, and saw the required state, within the stated scope. It is different from a system's "OK" reply. It can become out of date, and it proves nothing about systems ORVIA cannot read. (CL-09)

**Which processing boundary is controlled?**
Only the local, supported send-admission point in the prototype. At admission it rechecks current consent and the published policy. It does not intercept other software, and it cannot recall messages already sent. (CL-10)

**How are unknown effects handled?**
A lost reply is recorded as *outcome unknown*, not *failed*. ORVIA then records a separate reconciliation attempt and reads the target or its receipt. The uncertain attempt is never rewritten as a success. If the read cannot settle the question, the item stays unknown and assigned. Retries are bounded and escalate to a person. The same principle applies to a person's own request: Work specifies an explicit authorised retry of the *same* retained request. Full-reload recovery remains a Codex dependency; the page must not fabricate a fresh request identity when the original is lost. (CL-11)

**How do customer and vendor identities differ?**
Staff and data principals have separate sessions scoped to their organisation. Organisation administrators manage their own installation. The prototype accepts no Cyberfyx vendor identity and has no vendor remote administration. Commerce and release signing sit in a separate trust domain from customer evidence keys. (CL-04; CONTRACT §1, §7)

**What stays customer-local?**
Operational records, identifiers, evidence, logs, workflow history and test targets all run inside the local environment:

- no vendor analytics, crash uploads, remote fonts or CDN scripts;
- the Cyberfyx website is marketing only, not a processing plane.

The claim will be backed by the T26 egress capture for the tested interval. (CL-17)

**Why is runtime AI excluded?**
Version 1 is defined as a non-model release in the approved plan, and the learned-AI capabilities are designated for Version 2. For this prototype, excluding models means:

- no model is shipped;
- there are no hosted model calls, embeddings or training, and no GPU dependency;
- customer data never needs to leave the environment for inference.

The result is deterministic behaviour that can be tested. (CL-18)

**What production gates remain?**
The prototype can pass on synthetic data and still be far from production. The full master release gates still apply: security (including penetration testing), legal review, real connectors, deployment and ingress separation, high availability and disaster recovery, licensing and updates, and support processes. (EXECUTION_PLAN §8)

**Can we show it to a customer?**
No. It is an internal demonstrator on fictional data. Customer pilots are subject to the full master gates.

**Is the demo live or recorded?**
Every recording carries a "RECORDING — not live" caption with its build and date. None exists yet.

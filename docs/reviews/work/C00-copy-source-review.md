# C00 critical copy and source consistency review

Work, successor to Cowork, 2026-09-16. Inspected source: `1e23bbe3b31b4f1d50f096bdcc26bf105d1b1cac` (PR #19 A05 merged). This is an authored Work decision and self-review, not an independent engineering review or human acceptance. C00 has no B00 acceptance dependency. B00 consumes this specification; remaining consumer work does not make the specification a claim that screens exist.

## Scope of the decision

Work accepts the display bindings listed below to the already accepted contract **0.2.1**, accepted source `58ceddcd73b9b9f0717553bbd1e2fff3f7389abe`. Accepted A01 authentication is at `50cb4daeded9253c4f7cca4f742cb212c10aa5b7`. These decisions add no API fields, stored states or routes. The executable transport **0.4.0**, introduced by A05, remains pending consolidated review; signed commands retain **0.3.0**. Source-backed descriptions below do not accept those implementations, their tests or the whole later contract.

| Copy / binding | Decision and source | Consumer check still required |
|---|---|---|
| `signin.staff.*`, `signin.portal.heading/button`, `permission.action.setup_mfa` | Work owns the visible labels. Use the two existing auth clients and native protocol, generic failure text, and the A01 enrollment/challenge flow documented in `handoffs/codex/A01-UI-e1fa052.md`. Enrollment is not business authority; display locally returned enrollment material only to that user. | B01: enrollment, enrolled challenge, sign-out, dual-domain denial and safe native error mapping. No raw error-object rendering. |
| `state.workflow.ACCEPTED.detail` | “Withdrawal recorded” is conditional on the immutable receipt being WITHDRAWN, its workflow_id matching this workflow and workflow.state being ACCEPTED. `packages/domain/src/consent.ts` creates a workflow only on withdrawal at this source. If a future trigger cannot satisfy the guard, use the generic accepted badge without this detail. | B03: guard positive/negative cases; never show withdrawal text for a grant. |
| `overview.card.unverified` | Label: “Obligations without current verification”. `evidence.ts` counts CURRENT_SCOPED_OBSERVATION obligations for which `obligationSatisfied` is false, including absent, stale, unavailable or unsatisfied reads and obsolete scope. A past successful observation alone is insufficient. `completion.ts` is the source predicate. | T21/B03: count parity, freshness and scope changes. The four workflow cards count workflows; the remaining four count obligations and can overlap. Never sum them or calculate a completion percentage. The execution-state counts also retain unknown/failed/manual states after a separate criterion is satisfied; they are not counts of outstanding work. |
| `state.action.FAILED.detail`, `state.decision.ALLOW.basis`, `state.decision.BLOCK.detail` and `reason.*` | Use the explicit code-to-copy catalogue in UI_COPY. The existing contract permits reason codes; the catalogue is display data, not a new enum or authority rule. Codes were read from the policy, SDK, processing, agent, simulator and evidence sources. Match the decision/receipt state as well as the code. Unknown or contradictory codes use a neutral fallback; they never confer ALLOW, trigger retry or imply observation. | B03/B04: both purposes, unknown codes and incompatible states; T15/T16. Do not expose staff target detail to principals. |

The aggregation definition and reason catalogue are Work's bounded UX decisions based on the inspected producer. Changes to the producer predicate or reason semantics require a new cross-check. UI_COPY records the exact source hashes. Existing API shapes, consumer bindings, browser results and acceptance status remain separate.

## Resolved source questions and explicit display exclusions

- The portal currently returns only published `promotional_marketing` choices. `order_service_demo` is a separate staff policy/decision demonstration, never a principal marketing control. Suppress the optional portal service card until a supported source provides its data.
- Notice publication occurs through distinct-reviewer publication of the exact policy version; there is no standalone notice-publish action. Suppress `notices.publish`; do not invent an endpoint.
- Own receipt history exists at `/api/v1/portal/me/consents/{purpose_id}/history`. Preserve P-RECEIPTS and the selected purpose, including pagination and own-principal scope. Its 0.3.0 introduction and 0.4.0 transport review remain explicit; “no list route exists” is obsolete.
- The A05 capabilities endpoint returns configured connector records, not the authoritative 33-module programme register. W-CAPABILITIES must show the genuine register with its original IDs/names/depth/release/statuses, and a separately labelled runtime connector section. This display decision requires no invented replacement DTO. Codex supplies the actual consumer-compatible transport/import and tests under F-029.
- Overview has no separate unverifiable/not-satisfied/stale counts or per-workflow unresolved count. Suppress the three unsupported cards and the numeric NEEDS_ATTENTION summary; use the supported detail text and obligation rows. An empty failures page with a non-null next_cursor is not the end of the collection. No oldest-first or unsupported server-filter promise is made. FailureList returns Obligation records without owner/system/workflow navigation fields; associate only by exact obligation IDs in authorized workflow detail, or leave that detail unavailable. Never guess an owner or link from a position in the list.
- Reconciliation creates a durable read attempt and preserves the original uncertain command. A05 has no “safe new effect retry” signal; keep that action suppressed. Coverage read checks and actual fresh observations remain distinct from declared restrict capability. A05 evidence exports contain `tests: []`; do not present them as acceptance-result exports.

## Uncertain-write corrections

The former reload instructions in `error.staff.503` and `error.staff.network_change` were inconsistent with the specified same-tab request holder. They are replaced with an in-app check that preserves the original request. Do not refresh the page, replace the original epoch/payload/key, or infer rollback from an unchanged read. The same principle applies to generic retry hints; a hint cannot override an outstanding request.

`EPOCH_CONFLICT` also covers an expired/used interaction or changed notice, not only a change in another window. Conflict text must not invent the cause. Show “latest choice loaded” only after that response and a successful authenticated current-choice read. A read alone does not settle an uncertain write. An original authorised replay returning its matching receipt is a separate positive outcome. `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` requires preserving the original identity and investigating the mismatch, not silently making a fresh request.

Work specified these recovery rules; B01/B02 have not implemented or browser-tested them. The conditional “previous choice is unchanged” copy remains suppressed. No persistence of session secrets or operational records in browser storage is authorized.

## Review result

The source questions above have concrete bindings or deliberate display exclusions. UX brief, copy catalogue, all 28 journeys and the 12-step synthetic scenario are delivered as C00 implementation inputs. Document-tool regression execution is recorded in `docs/reviews/cowork/VALIDATION.md`. C00 remains submitted for acceptance with this self-review; external cross-check and human acceptance are not fabricated. C01's independent register, source mapping, commands and evidence intake are completed to the inspected source; B00 acceptance remains open. C02 cannot qualify without A07/B06 and two real candidate rehearsals.


## Delivery cross-verification — exact display definition

Work self-review against merged main `9bb8f2900909997f63db864eeea1211523aa5819`; application sources are byte-identical to the A05 source inspected above. The code/state pairs were rechecked against the actual Rego decision, SDK fallbacks, admission transaction, command receipt, simulator and reconciliation producers. ALLOW maps only to CURRENT_MARKETING_AUTHORITY / EXPLICIT_SYNTHETIC_ORDER_CONDITION; BLOCK to CONDITIONS_NOT_SATISFIED / SERVICE_CONDITION_EXPIRED; unavailable policy/target results to INDETERMINATE. APPLIED means ACKNOWLEDGED, provider uncertainty means EFFECT_UNKNOWN, remaining command codes mean FAILED. The three unsuccessful reconciliation reasons mean INCONCLUSIVE. Copy IDs retain their exact code association; unknown or incompatible values use the neutral fallback.

The overview counts use the inspected `evidence.ts` / `completion.ts` predicate and mixed units described above. Execution-state counts are not unresolved-obligation counts. The following fingerprint binds the full `reason_mappings` and `overview_bindings` objects, including exact source hashes, states, copy IDs, fallbacks, predicates and limits, serialized as UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys and compact separators. Changing any binding requires an explicit source cross-check and refreshed review; merely keeping a valid source hash is insufficient. This is Work's authored display decision and self-review, not consumer execution or independent acceptance.

## Source-guard re-review at the frozen candidate — 2026-09-17

Candidate `81431d64afb8dd613c96d942402d8c0d8cc07ac0`. Three source guards in `docs/ux/UI_COPY.json` fired
because their bound application source changed since `1e23bbe3b31b4f1d50f096bdcc26bf105d1b1cac`. Each was
re-read before rebinding. **No display decision changed**; only the recorded source identity was advanced.

1. **`state.action.SKIPPED.detail` accepted field.** `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` `Obligation` gained
   one required field, `task_version`, as part of the coordinated transport 0.5.0 manual-attestation
   correction. The accepted field for this copy entry, `skip_reason: SafeText.nullable()`, is byte-identical
   and still last in the object; `completion_criterion`, `observation`, `attestation` and
   `scope_still_current` are unchanged. The quote is advanced to the current exact definition so any future
   schema change re-triggers this review. The 0.2.1 approval binding is untouched.

2. **`reason_mappings.reconciliation` (`READ_UNAVAILABLE`, `STALE_SCOPE`, `DESIRED_STATE_NOT_OBSERVED`).**
   All three still originate from the single expression at `packages/domain/src/evidence.ts:39`, with
   unchanged meaning: `READ_UNAVAILABLE` when the observation state is `UNVERIFIABLE`, `STALE_SCOPE` when
   the scope is not current, `DESIRED_STATE_NOT_OBSERVED` otherwise, and `null` when satisfied. The file
   hash moved because of the A06 change `3c2ee18f568cebb3c4add734c6c94a3f68e2c692`, which persists real
   regression outcomes and does not touch these codes. The safe unknown-code policy
   `NO_AUTHORITY_NO_RETRY_NO_OBSERVATION_INFERENCE` is retained.

3. **`overview_bindings`.** Bound to the same `packages/domain/src/evidence.ts`, so it moved for the same
   reason. The predicate source `packages/domain/src/completion.ts` is **unchanged** and its hash still
   matches. Count units remain `WORKFLOWS` for accepted/running/needs_attention/completed and
   `OBLIGATIONS` for effect_unknown/manual_required/failed/unverified, and `may_sum_cards` remains false.
   The runtime behaviour was re-confirmed by the evidence integration suite at this candidate
   (`overview workflow counts come from scoped persisted rows`, `overview exposes unknown and manual axes`).

This is Work-authored semantic re-review against inspected source. It is not application acceptance,
browser acceptance or a human rehearsal.

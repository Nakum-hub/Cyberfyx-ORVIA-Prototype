# W02 — integrated failure, security and recovery review

> r4 current-routing note (Work, 2026-09-16): former Cowork duties now belong to Work; unfinished Claude Code/B-task UI and browser duties now belong to Codex. Historical observations below retain their original dates and authorship. Current main includes PR #16's A02 expiry correction, awaiting consolidated review; see CURRENT_STATE.md and `handoffs/work/C00-C02-r4-delivery.md`.

**Latest intake, not acceptance:** A03 was human-merged in PR #11 at 16:26:17 UTC while this package was being published: implementation `034100943f2c2f2b8e8934921501093746962b9b`, publication `397cb370bedaf45c3f62409e88fb891f7cd3b23e`, main `8a45911be8f86f7a35bfe1153bd40f968f4aecac`. Manifest metadata still says contract 0.3.0/PENDING_WORK_REVIEW. Only commit/path/publication metadata was inspected; A03 implementation and producer results remain queued for the requested consolidated review. This does not close A02 F01 or any Work gate.

**Integration update:** Work PR #10 was human-merged to `4eb346f0974bb38abcc541744cc57bdf87428f1a` during preparation; its tree exactly matches `33aa63a630619d170e1709b8cea2b30a78b6b78f`. This package is based on that integration. The earlier application snapshot remains the last runtime reviewed.

**Work preparation:** COMPLETE at the inspected source. **Gated review:** BLOCKED; no integrated A03–A07 or B04 candidate reviewed here. **Date:** 2026-09-16. **Profile:** CUSTOMER_LOCAL_SYNTHETIC. This is a completed review specification and current gap assessment, not an executed application test.

The human authorized preparing W02 before its normal start dependencies are accepted, so the later code can be reviewed together. Canonical start dependencies remain W01/A03; acceptance dependencies remain A04/A05/A06/B04. No application, schema, dependency or test implementation is assigned to Work.

## Source and retained decision

| Input | Reviewed identity / meaning |
|---|---|
| Last application review snapshot | `a5b6ff73c4fca4aa02e110ee5f11a121b1a7563b`; A02 implementation `3242521e59966885d8053747a82d96cb92ea55d5` |
| Prior Work package | `33aa63a630619d170e1709b8cea2b30a78b6b78f`; A01 review `10f8e11830c43a875bfc29d05f650c9f0d853c33`; A02 review `b3c582f86c78ca565562b95aa692a8b84f672770` |
| Authority | Approved master revision 1.3, SHA-256 `527daa1d6a2a7564a61d0375e540ca66b1bc8f33f4e71d327b0f6cb0bf6dbef6`; Plan 1.0; ADR-001 retained |
| Contract | Accepted baseline 0.2.1; executable 0.3.0 candidate awaiting A02 correction. Later changes require Codex's versioned producer/consumer proposal and Work semantic review. |
| Known implementation | A01 accepted; A02 reviewed with one open medium finding. The worker files inspected at this source are bootstrap probes; they do not establish the A03 business workflow. |
| Execution in this checkpoint | Work document and tracker validation only. Earlier A01/A02 unit, contract, type, lint and provenance results remain attributed to their original candidates. |

Prototype test IDs below refer to `tracking/acceptance.json`, not the different T-numbering in master §217. The matrix expands review questions for the existing tests; it creates no new application contract or replacement test registry. Master §§17–18, 25, 30, 35–36, 40–47, 91–92, 163–164 and 217 govern the boundaries.

## Trust boundaries and review questions

| Boundary / assets | Threat to challenge | Required control and evidence | Owning path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser → staff/principal API; sessions, receipts, configuration | Caller-selected tenant/principal, role impersonation, confused staff/principal cookies, stale privilege, CSRF | Server establishes scope and capability for each request; own-principal receipt filtering; separate auth domains; real denials and permitted controls. | Codex `packages/auth/**`, `packages/authz/**`, API/server; Claude Code UI/browser |
| API → PostgreSQL → outbox/Temporal; accepted consent and action history | Cross-environment references, pool-context leak, partial commit, duplicate dispatch, stale consent events | Tenant predicates and non-bypass RLS; atomic commit; stable event/workflow identity; current epoch and generation checks after waits and at effects. | Codex DB/domain/worker |
| Worker → signing authority → local agent; commands and target credentials | Valid signature with wrong scope, replay, expired instruction, budget abuse, arbitrary host/SQL, revoked machine authority | Independent agent validation of exact bindings and current authority; durable deduplication; restricted operation/target credentials; negative and healthy tests. | Codex agent/connectors/contracts/infrastructure |
| Sender → processing decision → admission; permission to write a simulated send | Reuse of a preview/old grant, policy outage, withdrawal racing admission, service-purpose confusion | Current server facts at the tested linearisation point; no send when withdrawal commits first; independent service condition; fail closed/queue on uncertainty. | Codex policy SDK/processing policy/demo targets |
| Target → observation → evidence/UI/export | ACK promoted to observed effect, wrong generation, stale observation, manual closure hiding a gap, fabricated counters, unauthorized export | Separate scoped read and freshness; independent state axes; visible unresolved required obligations; scoped audited local export; DB-to-UI comparisons. | Codex domain/connectors/API; Claude Code views |
| Operator → fault/reset/restore and local runtime network | Wrong database reset, shared lane state, restored withdrawn audience sending, external assets/telemetry, secret disclosure | Named isolated synthetic profile; guarded operator actions; target-only quarantine and authoritative reconciliation; actual backend/browser network and log evidence. | Codex testing/infrastructure/scripts; Claude Code browser; human authorization |

The agent's valid signature proves attribution and integrity of an instruction, not its current applicability. RLS is defense in depth under a trusted server context, not a claim against a compromised database administrator. The supported send boundary is local admission; no global interception or recall of previously handed-off messages is promised.

## Prepared integrated review matrix

**Every row below is AWAITING_CANDIDATE; associated full scenarios are NOT_RUN.** Steps are required future reproductions/controls, not commands executed by Work. A finding is opened only when source or an actual result supplies evidence; absence of a later implementation is an intake dependency, not an invented defect.

| Check / prototype tests | Reproduction and healthy control to inspect | Expected behavior and minimum artifact | Fix / execution owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| W02-R01 — complete scope (T03–T05, T22) | Use Aster/Birch, sibling environment, two Aster principals, auditor/member and valid scoped machine identities. Substitute IDs in reads, writes, jobs, command receipts, reconciliation and export; remove a queued actor's assignment. Run equivalent permitted requests. | Deny before disclosure/effect, including async work and response artifacts. Show authenticated HTTP records, scoped DB assertions, job/agent identities and pool-context success/rollback controls. | Codex A03/A05/A06: authz, DB, API, worker/agent. Claude Code B04: visible denied states. |
| W02-R02 — consent replay and generation (T08–T10, T13) | Delay grant event N behind withdrawal N+1. Create genuinely new consent N+2 and a new target generation, then release the old cleanup. Hold a target mutation until authority changes. | Epoch never regresses; fresh interaction advances it; old worker/command cannot modify the newer generation. Current scope is enforced at target effect, not just planning. Preserve ordered DB/event/target history and guarded-write assertions. | Codex A03/A06: domain, worker, agent, connector, DB. F01 remains A02-owned. |
| W02-R03 — durable accepted work (T08, T11, T13) | Interrupt after domain commit/before dispatch, after dispatch/before outbox acknowledgment, and after target effect/before workflow acknowledgment. Restart with the same durable stores; redeliver the same event/command. | Receipt/event/outbox survive; stable workflow and logical action; no lost accepted request or duplicate unsafe effect. Unknown outcomes reconcile. Require durable IDs, effect counts, crash positions, restart transcripts and before/after target reads. | Codex A03/A06: worker, DB, connectors, recovery tests. |
| W02-R04 — signed command limits (T12, T27) | Test altered signature and validly signed wrong tenant, installation, environment, action/resource, policy/epoch/generation, digest, capability/version or budget. Exercise expiry after waiting, duplicate nonce/ID, revoked machine permission, arbitrary operation/host/SQL; retain a valid one-record control. | Independent agent denial before credentials/effect; unknown schema rejected; binding and current applicability preserved; durable replay reconciliation and bounded attempts. Show signed fixture provenance without keys, agent denial/target no-effect assertions and allowlist boundaries. | Codex A03/A06: agent/connectors/contracts/security tests. |
| W02-R05 — current admission ordering (T14) | Queue marketing while granted, commit withdrawal, then admit. Coordinate withdrawal/admission with explicit barriers in both orderings. Try a cached preview and stale epoch. | Withdrawal committed before admission means BLOCK and zero send row. Document the tested lock/linearisation protocol; earlier admission is represented honestly. Evidence includes request/commit/admission ordering, decision inputs and exact send-table counts. | Codex A04/A06: policy SDK/demo targets; Claude Code B04 browser exercise. |
| W02-R06 — independent processing purpose (T15–T16) | Run separately configured service traffic with valid, missing and wrong-purpose conditions. Make OPA unavailable, timeout, return undefined/malformed output; restore it. | Service uses its own approved server condition; marketing withdrawal is not a universal service permission. INDETERMINATE blocks/queues marketing with no send; recovery succeeds without fail-open fallback. | Codex A04/A06: processing policy and enforcement tests. |
| W02-R07 — actual effect and observation (T13, T18, T21) | Remove a real synthetic CRM member and separately read it. Use ACK_WITHOUT_EFFECT, wrong-resource/generation read, expired observation and permission loss. Inspect the actual query/adapter producing observation. | ACK alone cannot satisfy CURRENT_SCOPED_OBSERVATION. Wrong/stale/missing read is mismatch, STALE or UNVERIFIABLE; unresolved required obligations remain visible. Preserve independent target read and persisted observation provenance. | Codex A03/A05/A06; Claude Code B03/B04 displays. |
| W02-R08 — applied then timeout (T17, T19, T21) | Apply restriction in REST simulator and drop response. Capture target state, original EFFECT_UNKNOWN attempt and next reconciliation. Repeat with unavailable/ambiguous receipt/read support. | No invented ACK or blind unsafe retry. Supported read/receipt retains its evidence class; unresolved remains explicit. Show attempt/reconciliation IDs, history, effect counts and bounded classification decision. | Codex A05/A06: connector, simulator, domain/evidence tests. |
| W02-R09 — bounded retry and coverage (T19–T21) | Fail with known unavailable/denied responses; exhaust the configured budget. Remove mutation/read permission mid-flow. Include the unsupported legacy target and a manual attestation. | Bounded attempts/backoff and assigned escalation; no swallowed error or infinite retry. Permission loss changes coverage; manual attestation remains attributed and cannot masquerade as an independent read. | Codex A05/A06; Claude Code B03/B04. |
| W02-R10 — aggregation and local evidence (T18, T20–T22) | Compare persisted events/policy/plan/attempts/observations with receipt, workflow, counters and exported JSON. Use empty, partially satisfied, stale, unknown and required-manual sets. Alter exported evidence bytes where an integrity claim is supported. | Completion follows each declared criterion; empty/unresolved sets are NEEDS_ATTENTION. Local authenticated audited scope-filtered export includes limits. Digest validation detects the scoped corruption it claims, without asserting protection from an administrator rewriting store/keys. | Codex A05/A06; Claude Code B03/B04; Cowork C01/C02 claim wording. |
| W02-R11 — real regression (T23–T24) | Execute healthy → deliberately broken test-only sender → repaired healthy on a named fixture. Inspect how the faulty behavior changes the boundary and how the assertion observes actual sends. | Healthy PASS, real violation detected with assertion FAIL in the deliberately broken subrun, healthy repair PASS. T24 succeeds only when detection/repair are demonstrated; a fault selector choosing the result is unacceptable. Retain all subrun evidence and distinct ERROR behavior. | Codex A06: testing/fault fixtures; Claude Code B04: Test Lab and browser. |
| W02-R12 — target restore quarantine (T10, T25) | Accept withdrawal, snapshot current authoritative state, restore an older target-only audience into quarantine. Attempt send before, during and after reconciliation; interrupt/restart reconciliation; include newer-generation control. | Quarantine precedes traffic; authoritative consent/epochs/history are not rolled back; restricted marketing remains blocked. Releasing quarantine requires actual reconciliation/read evidence. Report observed timings only; no full control-plane recovery or enterprise RPO/RTO claim. | Codex A06: recovery/target fixtures. Human authorizes named synthetic restore. |
| W02-R13 — reset/fault isolation (T28) | Inspect guard and try missing/wrong profile, non-demo target, absent confirmation/authorization and live-job refusal. Execute authorized synthetic reset only in the designated profile; verify another lane's stores and exported evidence remain intact. | Fault/reset unavailable outside allowed private synthetic scope. Separate Compose project, ports, database/volume, Temporal state and output paths; a worktree alone is insufficient isolation. No shared or production reset. | Codex A06/A07: scripts/testing/infrastructure. Human authorizes actual reset. |
| W02-R14 — egress and local runtime (T26) | Inspect shipped assets/dependencies/configuration; then block vendor/model internet and run the complete core scenario. Observe browser requests and backend/worker/agent/OPA/Temporal traffic over a recorded interval, including failure paths. | Local assets and deterministic core work; no unapproved analytics, crash upload, CDN/font/model/provider fallback or operational-data destination. Require actual network configuration/capture and successful controls; grep or an idle capture alone cannot pass this gate. | Codex A06; Claude Code B04; human supplies approved network controls. |
| W02-R15 — session/input/secrets/transport (T27, T12) | Review new input sizes/unknown fields, origin/session errors, revocation/rate-limit/lockout behavior, log redaction, local secret placement and dependency/secret scans. Inspect protected candidate TLS and service binds; deny untrusted certificates without disabling verification. | No sensitive response/log/command material; bounded requests, explicit scan coverage and triage; no fabricated PASS when scanner unavailable. Development HTTP remains restricted/documented and is not qualified protected transport. Preserve prior approval constraints on scan tooling. | Codex A06/A07: auth/API/infrastructure; Claude Code B04 browser/session controls. |
| W02-R16 — real UI state (T21–T24, T29) | Follow actual staff setup → principal grant/withdraw → receipt → workflow/failure/evidence/Test Lab with refresh, loading, empty, denied and service-error states. Compare UI output to API/DB. | Generated client semantics, real persistence, accurate ACK/observed/unknown/manual/freshness labels, accessible error states and no fixture fallback presented as runtime success. Stub-only UI tests remain separately labelled. | Claude Code B04, with Codex API fixes and Cowork copy review. |

## Evidence intake and findings

For every supplied run require the exact source SHA/tree, contract/build and lockfile identity; command, UTC start/end, exit code; named isolated profile/fixtures; assertions and expected/actual effects; raw logs and local artifact hashes; and whether Work executed it, reproduced it, or only inspected a producer run. Reject broken artifact references, candidate mismatch or a summary that drops failures. Source snapshots taken before a final commit retain their dirty identity until verified against that commit.

The only open implementation finding known at this checkpoint is **MEDIUM W01-A02-F01**, owned by Codex A02 in `packages/domain/src/configuration.ts` and `consent.ts`: transaction-start expiry across waits. Full reproduction, expected behavior and retest are in [W01_A02_REVIEW.md](W01_A02_REVIEW.md). Work has not run the PostgreSQL reproduction. No W02 implementation finding is claimed before its source/evidence arrives.

Future findings use: **ID; severity and rationale; task/exact file and source SHA; reproduced steps or source evidence with execution status; expected behavior; owning lane; correction SHA; exact retest and result; closure/remaining risk.** Route fixes to the owner, then review its correction. A missing required run is a blocked gate, not an invented application FAIL. Critical/High findings and the non-waivable scope/authority/unsafe-effect/false-verification/egress blockers prevent a favorable demo recommendation; applicable production blockers remain separately governed by the master.

## W02 exit and handoff

Accept W01 and A03, inspect the actual integrated A04/A05/A06/B04 candidate, complete this matrix with evidence, retest blocking corrections, and retain all unresolved limitations. Only then may Work close W02. Codex's authorized serial preparation of A07 may proceed, but its acceptance depends on W02; A08 remains unpromoted.

Current executed full scenarios: **T01–T34 NOT_RUN**. No application services, reset, network test or rehearsal ran during this document checkpoint. Work's [handoff](../../../handoffs/work/W02-preparation-a5b6ff7.md) and [consolidated intake](WORK_REVIEW_QUEUE.md) are ready for the later candidate. Human integration and release remain explicit decisions.

## W02 consolidated review — 2026-09-17

**Review content: ACCEPTED** at candidate `81431d64afb8dd613c96d942402d8c0d8cc07ac0`, source inventory SHA-256
`e949d8c43c0dfffcea2e332eb7baa7eb2a052f0524709e6d533dcd566304e437`, contract 0.5.0 / signed command 0.3.0.
**The canonical W02 ticket stays BLOCKED** for one reason only: its acceptance dependency B04 sits behind
`B00 ← C00`, and C00 acceptance is an outstanding human decision. The engineering under review is merged
and qualified. Everything above this line is retained unchanged.

| Boundary | Result at this candidate | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Durable workflow, signed commands, stale/replayed authority | PASS, exit 0, 32 assertions | `B06-exec-2026-09-17T11-55-06.951Z`; `A07-workflow-integration-1789646136254-…` |
| Current admission and degraded policy safety | PASS, exit 0, 46 assertions; missing/malformed/outage OPA all INDETERMINATE with no send, recovery still blocks withdrawal | `B06-exec-2026-09-17T11-57-02.765Z`; `A07-send-enforcement-1789646240320-…` |
| Observation, completion, manual action, reconciliation, export, counts | PASS, exit 0, 69 assertions | `B06-exec-2026-09-17T11-45-47.355Z`; `A07-evidence-integration-1789645594362-…` |
| Regression detection, quarantined restore, interrupted recovery | PASS, exit 0, 70 assertions (T23–T25) | `B06-exec-2026-09-17T11-58-46.926Z`; `A07-regression-integration-1789646604777-…` |
| Transport and lifecycle | PASS, exit 0 (12 and 17 assertions, two full supervised cycles) | `…T12-06-43.711Z`; `…T12-05-05.401Z` |
| Runtime egress (T26) | PASS, exit 0, 13 assertions at this exact candidate; image label matches the candidate source inventory, internal-only network, no published host ports, canary never reached, deny-all DNS saw only the controlled query | `B06-exec-2026-09-17T12-50-28.741Z`; `A07-network-qualification-1789649464712-…` |
| Integrated browser flow | **16/16 PASS, exit 0** over 9 min 59 s at the exact candidate commit and tree; all seven mandatory suites; Chromium over normal trusted HTTPS with no bypass; per-context network records assert no request leaves the application origin | `handoffs/codex/browser/B06-playwright-2026-09-17T12-36-17.847Z/results.json` |

### Findings closed

- **FINAL-B06-F02 — manual-attestation contract gap.** The read now exposes the authoritative stored task
  version, the UI submits exactly that version, and the server enforces it. Proven by 14 evidence-suite
  assertions (authoritative stored version; exactly one of two concurrent current-version attestations
  accepted; identical replay accepted and preserving the original operation; conflicting replay denied;
  stale version denied on a new request; exactly one revision increment; attribution; **no automated
  observation created**; manual cannot satisfy an independent-read criterion; old attestation not current
  after fresh consent) plus the browser case *B03 manual task uses its read version, preserves replay and
  rejects a stale tab*. Delivered through the canonical generator as transport 0.5.0; no second
  hand-written DTO and no storage migration.
- **FINAL-B06-F05 — browser fixture ownership timeout.** Verified by a complete 16-test run lasting
  9 min 59 s, well beyond the loopback relay's five-minute idle limit, with no lease loss.
- **FINAL-CONT-F06 — Test Lab operator exit contract.** The documented contract is: exit 0 when the
  enqueued run reached a recorded terminal result, exit 1 only when the runner itself could not complete
  it. A detected broken control is a completed execution whose durable business result is FAIL. Confirmed
  at runtime: the regression integration suite invokes the runner through `execFile` for
  `MARKETING_WITHDRAWAL_BROKEN_CONTROL` and that call resolves while run `7f48cebe-02ba-47aa-bdf5-15b2f7842e2e`
  is stored as FAIL with `expected_fault_detection: true`. `scripts/demo-run.ts` and
  `tests/security/network-core.ts` depend on the same semantics. No product assertion was weakened.
- **FINAL-CONT-F07 — interruption barrier.** `app.purposes` does not exist; the actual configuration table
  is `app.purpose_versions`. The barrier now locks the correct table and protects acquisition, setup,
  operator termination, rollback and release.

### Open finding

- **FINAL-CONT-F08 — LOW, no per-screen browser acceptance producer.** `evidence_rules.screen_errors`
  requires a raw report of `kind: "BROWSER_ACCEPTANCE"` carrying `screen_ids` before any screen may claim a
  browser result. The Playwright reporter writes `results.json` without `kind` or `screen_ids`, so C02
  screen-level browser claims cannot be evidenced even though the suite passes 16/16. Owner: browser
  harness (`tests/e2e/reporter.ts`). Not corrected here: it is outside this session's recorded bounded
  scope and needs its own decision.

### Retained limitations

Synthetic targets only; one effect attempt followed by read reconciliation; target-only recovery with no
control-plane disaster recovery; development SHA-256 checksums with no production signing; backend-scoped
egress observation with no whole-host assurance; no enterprise security certification, penetration test,
legal approval or production readiness. Work-lane acceptance of executed evidence only.

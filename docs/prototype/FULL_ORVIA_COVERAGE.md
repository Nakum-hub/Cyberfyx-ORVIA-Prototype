# ORVIA prototype: full coverage of the approved master

**Writer:** Work · **Date:** 2026-09-18 · **Candidate:** `c5655eacf86a68e4aa76ae3b79a1328517c0d23d` · **Status:** dated snapshot

This document maps every one of the 218 numbered top-level sections of the approved ORVIA Version 1 master
to what this prototype actually implements, and says plainly what remains for full ORVIA. It exists so that
a reader can see the whole programme and the built slice side by side without either being overstated. It is
an engineering mapping, not an acceptance record: the canonical acceptance tests T01–T34 remain NOT_RUN and
no claim here is promoted to `EVIDENCED` under `docs/demo/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`.

---

## How to reproduce this mapping

The approved master is `docs/source/ORVIA_Version_1_Unified_Master_with_Version_2_AI_Roadmap.md`,
SHA-256 `527daa1d6a2a7564a61d0375e540ca66b1bc8f33f4e71d327b0f6cb0bf6dbef6`.

```bash
# 1. Confirm the source identity.
sha256sum docs/source/ORVIA_Version_1_Unified_Master_with_Version_2_AI_Roadmap.md

# 2. List the 218 numbered top-level sections, in order.
grep -E "^# [0-9]+\. " docs/source/ORVIA_Version_1_Unified_Master_with_Version_2_AI_Roadmap.md

# 3. Confirm the count is exactly 218.
grep -cE "^# [0-9]+\. " docs/source/ORVIA_Version_1_Unified_Master_with_Version_2_AI_Roadmap.md

# 4. Read the authoritative module-level status register (33 modules, M01-M33).
cat tracking/capabilities.json
```

The untracked working-tree file `ORVIA_V1_Master_with_Engineering_Breakdown(full idea).md` carries the same
218-section list with a prepended engineering breakdown. It is context only; every citation in this document
is to the approved master above.

This is a **dated snapshot taken on 2026-09-18** against the frozen candidate named in `CURRENT_STATE.md`.
It is not self-updating. If the source, the register or the code changes, this mapping must be regenerated.

## Methodology

### The six statuses

| Status | Definition |
|---|---|
| `DEMONSTRATED` | The section's core behaviour is built **and** exercised by a named executing suite in the customer-local synthetic profile, at CORE, LIGHT or SANDBOX depth. It never means the master module is delivered. |
| `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED` | A named, bounded part of the section exists and is exercised; the rest is absent. |
| `FOUNDATION_ONLY` | Architecture or structure exists that the future capability would extend — a contract, a table, a registered system kind — but the section's own behaviour is not built. |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | Nothing is built. |
| `DEFERRED_V2` | The master assigns the section to Version 2 AI (sections 63–74 and related). |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_PROTOTYPE` | The section governs process, team, commercial, legal or deployment matters that a local synthetic prototype cannot demonstrate — for example §117 "20-PERSON ENGINEERING TEAM" or §218 "PRIMARY SOURCE REGISTER AND REVIEW LIMITS". |

Where a section was genuinely ambiguous, the weaker status was chosen.

### Sources of status

`tracking/capabilities.json` is authoritative for **module-level** status (M01–M33) and its per-module
`limitation` text is quoted or paraphrased rather than softened. Section-level statuses in the main table are
derived from that register plus direct inspection of the code, policy, scripts and tests. Every file path,
npm script name and module id cited below was checked to exist before it was written down.

### The percentages, and what they are not

The published percentage is **prototype coverage of master sections**. It is not ORVIA product completion,
not module completion, and not a compliance measure. A section counted as `DEMONSTRATED` may represent a
small bounded slice of a large master module.

Two figures are published, both from the same table.

```text
covered_sections   = DEMONSTRATED + PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED + FOUNDATION_ONLY

all-sections figure        = covered_sections / 218
applicable-sections figure = covered_sections / (218 - NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_PROTOTYPE)
```

`NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_PROTOTYPE` sections are **excluded from the denominator of the applicable-sections figure
only**. `DEFERRED_V2` and `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` sections stay in both denominators, because they are real
Version 1 or Version 2 scope that this prototype does not deliver. Both figures are shown together so that
neither can be quoted without the other.

---

## Results summary

| Status | Sections |
|---|---|
| `DEMONSTRATED` | 40 |
| `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED` | 63 |
| `FOUNDATION_ONLY` | 16 |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | 51 |
| `DEFERRED_V2` | 14 |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_PROTOTYPE` | 34 |
| **Total** | **218** |

Covered sections (`DEMONSTRATED` + `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED` + `FOUNDATION_ONLY`) = 40 + 63 + 16 = **119**.

| Figure | Calculation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Prototype coverage of **all** master sections | 119 / 218 | **54.6 %** |
| Prototype coverage of **applicable** master sections | 119 / (218 − 34) = 119 / 184 | **64.7 %** |

Read strictly: 119 of the 218 numbered sections have some built, inspectable presence in this prototype; 40
of those have a core behaviour that an executing suite actually exercises. Nothing in these numbers says a
master module is delivered.

## Capability areas

### What the prototype covers parts of

Each item names the master section and, where one exists, the capability register module.

- **Identity and access** — §§6, 7, 109, 110; M01. Real staff and principal sessions, scoped roles,
  privileged MFA, server-side capability checks against OPA.
- **Tenant isolation** — §§35, 36, 127; M02. Tenant, legal entity and environment predicates plus row-level
  security, proven by cross-tenant and sibling-environment denial.
- **Privacy control graph and control relationships** — §§4, 8, 105; M03. A relational control abstraction
  with registered systems and explicit mappings; a list and detail view, not a graph database.
- **Purposes** — §§9, 170; M04. Separate purposes each decided on their own authority.
- **Notices** — §19; M12. Immutable published versions with content digest and publication time.
- **Consent** — §§16, 17, 18; M11. Affirmative purpose-specific grant against an exact notice version,
  monotonic epoch, immutable receipt, withdrawal that never requires accepting a new notice.
- **Policy** — §§13, 14, 15; M04. Separate administrative and processing namespaces in OPA, immutable
  published versions, distinct-reviewer re-authentication, fail-closed on policy outage.
- **Workflow** — §§25, 149; M05. Transactional outbox, durable Temporal worker, bounded retry and
  reconciliation surviving restart.
- **Connector framework** — §§27, 28, 30, 171; M06. Locally signed, scope-bound agent commands against three
  declared synthetic connector kinds.
- **Verification** — §44; M07. Independent scoped reads recording method, generation, freshness and scope,
  kept separate from execution receipts.
- **Evidence** — §§45, 46, 133, 169; M08, M33. Receipt, action and observation timeline with authenticated
  JSON export carrying an integrity digest and explicit coverage limits.
- **Failure handling** — §§48, 49, 208; M18. Unresolved obligations across unknown effect, failed execution,
  unsupported or manual control, and missing verification, with counts that are never summed into a score.
- **Privacy testing** — §§57, 58, 59; M09. Executable regression scenarios with real assertions: healthy
  passes, a deliberately broken control keeps its real FAIL, a repaired run passes, an interrupted run is
  recorded as ERROR.
- **Recovery** — §§43, 149; M05. Worker and application restart recovery, and target-only quarantined
  restore. Not disaster recovery.
- **Principal portal** — §§20, 33; M13. A separate principal authentication domain showing own choices,
  notice, receipts and history, with grant and withdrawal.
- **Operational UI** — §§102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 184, 185. Workspace shell, overview, control map,
  workflows, evidence, failures, test lab and policy preview.

### What full ORVIA still contains

- **Full graph and discovery** — §§4, 62, 67. No estate discovery, lineage or drift detection.
- **Explicit data categories** — §§5, 9. The "what data" dimension is not modelled.
- **Data principal rights / DSR** — §§22, 23, 24; M14. Not implemented.
- **Retention and deletion** — §§50, 51, 52, 132; M15. Not implemented.
- **Processor and vendor management** — §53; M16. Registered synthetic systems only; no vendor registry,
  contract, DPA or assessment tracking.
- **Privacy incidents** — §§54, 55, 56, 108; M17. Not implemented.
- **Broader reporting** — §§134, 195, 196. Live counts exist; reports do not.
- **Production connector catalogue** — §29; M06. Three synthetic kinds only.
- **Enterprise SSO** — §§7, 80; M01. No SSO, SCIM or directory federation.
- **Licensing and entitlements** — §§76, 77, 94, 160; M27, M28. Not implemented.
- **Editions** — §§78, 79, 80, 81, 144, 145; M28. The register's `edition_entitlement` field is a plan
  reference, not an enforced entitlement.
- **Installer and update lifecycle** — §§85, 93, 146; M31. Not implemented.
- **Support and diagnostics** — §§95, 96; M30. Not implemented.
- **Production backup and disaster recovery** — §§91, 92. Not implemented.
- **Customer cloud deployment** — §§34, 86, 87, 194, 202. Outside the local synthetic profile.
- **High availability** — §§130, 131. Outside the local synthetic profile.
- **Restricted and air-gapped deployment** — §§32, 33. The tested interval showed no unapproved egress; that
  is not an air-gapped installer.
- **Production security hardening** — §§163, 164, 206. NOT_ASSESSED and governed separately by the master.
- **Version 2 AI** — §§63–74, 112, 113, 205; M19–M25. Deferred in full.

## The 218 sections

Columns: section number; master section title; status; the depth actually implemented; evidence paths, npm
script names, browser specs or module ids; and what remains for full ORVIA.

Suite names in the evidence column are npm scripts defined in `package.json` (for example `test:consent` runs
`tests/integration/consent/consent.test.ts`). Browser specs live under `tests/e2e/`.

## Limits of this mapping

- A status describes **the prototype slice only**. It is a statement about this repository at one dated
  snapshot, not about ORVIA the product.
- `DEMONSTRATED` never means the master module is delivered. It means a named behaviour is built and
  exercised by a named executing suite in the `CUSTOMER_LOCAL_SYNTHETIC` profile, against synthetic Aster and
  Birch fixtures and synthetic targets.
- The canonical acceptance tests **T01–T34 remain NOT_RUN**. Component suites passing at one exact candidate
  is engineering evidence, not application acceptance.
- The **two human rehearsals are outstanding**, C00 acceptance has not been made, and internal-demo readiness
  is NOT_READY. See `CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- No claim in `docs/demo/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md` is `EVIDENCED`. Nothing here may be quoted as a demo claim.
- **Nothing here is a legal or compliance claim.** CL-22 permits no legal-compliance statement of any kind.
  Production security, legal, supply-chain and full disaster recovery remain NOT_ASSESSED and are governed
  separately by the master.
- The percentages are a count of master sections with some built presence. They are not a measure of product
  completion, module completion, effort, or value delivered, and must always be quoted with their
  denominators.

# Continuation execution log

Every command below ran through the existing recorder `node tests/e2e/record.mjs B06 …`, which pins the
toolchain, sets `ORVIA_PROFILE=rehearsal` and a per-process `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and captures source
identity, UTC interval, exit code and log path. Suites ran **serially** against the exclusive rehearsal
database and ports. Nothing was overwritten; both failed runs are retained in place.

All runs share source tree `ae48b3249891…` as computed by the recorder. Runs labelled `b909be89` executed
the **identical file content** that was then committed as candidate `81431d64`; the post-commit build at
12:32 records the same tree hash, which is the evidence for that equivalence. Runs labelled `81431d64`
executed after the commit.

## Two retained failures

| Run | Why it failed | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `B06-exec-2026-09-17T11-46-50.057Z` — `tsx tests/security/auth.test.ts`, exit 1 | `wrong MFA code rejected` expected 401, actual **429**. The authentication rate-limit window had been consumed by the immediately preceding operator execution; the product rate-limited correctly. | Test-sequencing artefact, not a product defect. Rerun at 11:48:52 after the window cleared: PASS, 87/87. Suites spaced thereafter. |
| `B06-exec-2026-09-17T12-07-55.927Z` — `tsx tests/security/fixture-isolation.ts`, exit 1 | `Only the named Codex fixture profile is permitted`. The suite is pinned to `codex-a00`; the recorder forces `rehearsal`. | Correctly out of scope for this candidate. T28 is reported PARTIAL for exactly this reason. |

A third failure, `B06-exec-2026-09-17T12-51-36.045Z` (`tests/e2e/package.ts`, exit 1), is retained with its
partial output preserved as `.local/releases/81431d64…FAILED-gnu-tar-2026-09-17T12-51-36Z`. Cause:
GNU `tar` from Git Bash shadowed Windows `bsdtar`, which the packaging scripts require
(`tar: Cannot connect to C: resolve failed`). Rerun with `C:\Windows\System32` ahead on `PATH`: PASS. This
is recorded as a toolchain note in `docs/runbooks/OPERATOR.md`.

## Commands run outside the recorder

| Command | Result | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| `node --import tsx handoffs/work/final-prototype-continuation/inspect-state.ts` | read-only intake; confirmed the retained NOT_RUN record, no active worker/agent, no advisory locks | — |
| `certutil -user -store Root 8C592FC41BBD6AA18F42234085F6B8155466A190` (before) | `NTE_NOT_FOUND` — CA absent after the documented pause removal | `certificate-trust.json` |
| `certutil -user -addstore Root .local/profiles/rehearsal/tls/ca-cert.pem` | added, then independently re-read with matching serial and SHA-1 | `certificate-trust.json` |
| `tsx scripts/runtime-image.ts confirm:rehearsal` | runtime image rebuilt; label `orvia.source-tree` = `e949d8c4…`, revision = `81431d64…` | `A00-runtime-image-1789648554795-…json` |
| `python handoffs/work/final-prototype-continuation/verify-candidate.py` | **PASS — 242 checks, 0 failures** | `candidate-verification.json` |
| `node --import tsx scripts/validate-tracking.ts` | 23 tasks, 34 acceptance definitions and both Markdown views validated | — |
| `python docs/reviews/cowork/tools/build_pack.py` | five generated outputs rebuilt | `GENERATED_MANIFEST.json` |
| `python docs/reviews/cowork/tools/validate_docs.py --json` | **98 / 98** | — |
| `python -m unittest discover -s docs/reviews/cowork/tools/tests` | 62 tests; one stale negative control failed and was corrected (FINAL-CONT-F10), then passed | — |
| `docker network ls --filter label=orvia.network-test` / `docker ps -a --filter …` | empty — the T26 run removed everything it created | — |

## T26 status referenced by the W02 review

`tsx scripts/network-qualification.ts confirm:rehearsal` — **PASS, exit 0, 13 assertions** at candidate
`81431d64`, source inventory SHA-256 `e949d8c4…`. Evidence `handoffs/codex/browser/B06-exec-2026-09-17T12-50-28.741Z`, artifact
`handoffs/codex/artifacts/A07-network-qualification-1789649464712-61fc22c5-8651-4fd8-9679-cf7e0b0aef05.json`.
Limitation retained verbatim: observed backend core only, private Docker network, local deny-all DNS and a
controlled external-network canary; browser and host development egress remain unqualified; no real
vendor or model call.

## Recovery and final re-qualification — 2026-09-17 (after the session restart)

The browser run at `0ff33e9` failed 5 PASS / 11 FAIL. The cause is recorded as FINAL-CONT-F11 and is
**environmental, now demonstrated rather than assumed**:

| Step | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnose | `docker info` | daemon unreachable; none of `55433 / 57235 / 58183 / 4330` listening |
| Restore | `tsx scripts/services.ts up` | all four retained containers started from `Exited (255)`; volumes untouched, no reset |
| Confirm | `tsx scripts/preflight.ts` | PASS; ports listening on relay PID 16036 |
| Confirm | `inspect-state.ts` | `pending_or_running_runs: 0`, no active worker/agent |
| **Decisive diagnostic** | `playwright test configuration.spec.ts` alone | **PASS, exit 0** at `0ff33e9` — the first causal failure does not reproduce on healthy services |
| T27 gap | `node scripts/dependency-advisories.mjs` | **PASS**, 498 lock packages vs 7,408 reviewed advisories, **0 findings**, lockfile `b2694da1…` unchanged → `A07-dependency-advisories-1789656759904.json` |
| Re-freeze | `tsx scripts/runtime-image.ts confirm:rehearsal` | image label `66381551…`, revision `c383b9d9…` |
| Re-qualify | `playwright test` (all) | **16/16 PASS, exit 0**, `14:54:50Z → 15:08:01Z`, `B06-exec-2026-09-17T14-54-50.457Z` |
| Package | `tsx tests/e2e/package.ts confirm:rehearsal` | PASS, `browser_acceptance: PASS_ENGINEERING`, 398 browser evidence files, manifest `b23ad801…` |
| Verify | `verify-candidate.py` | **PASS — 242 checks, 0 failures** → `candidate-verification-c383b9d.json` |
| T26 browser half | per-context `networkAudit` records in the qualifying run | 16 files, **1,133 requests, 0 foreign-origin**, single origin `https://127.0.0.1:4330` |

The failing run at `0ff33e9` is retained in full. The 16/16 result at `81431d6` is **not** carried forward
to it, and neither older run is presented as qualification of the final candidate.
